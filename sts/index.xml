      <description>Fig 1   How does this (fake) text exchange (Fig 1) read to you? How do you read the response? To me, the response (&amp;ldquo;Mom&amp;rdquo;) is assertive and definitive. A declaration in periods. Two full stops in a short message. A refusal to react to what looks like a larger situation just out of sight if the viewer would scroll up. Some of the meaning of this text message is on the page and could easily be understood by any reader.</description>
